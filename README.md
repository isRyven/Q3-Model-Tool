# Q3 Model Tool

![Q3 Model Tool](../master/docs/img/RotateMD3_0.jpg)

Original `Q3-games Model Tool` for playermodel-makers, mappers and modders. Made by @core-c.

### Key features
* Calculation of LOD for playermodels, the user can manually adjust the LOD-Minimum per surface, and see the model-detail change on screen.
* Convert `.MAP` brushwork to a `.MD3` model, mappers can make a model in Radiant from just brushwork, and use this tool to convert it to an `MD3` model.
* Export frames from playermodels to animated `MD3`: save a selected range of frames to an animated `MD3`. Tags are also exported, so the mapper is able to attach other models to the final `MD3`.
* Combine frames from `MD3`-files into 1 final. With this option the user can create animated `MD3` models from a combination of frames from other `MD3` models.
* Loading `MDS`, and save it as an `MDM/MDX` combo.

## Compiling
The code is written in Pascal, and was originally built using `Delphi 7` IDE.
