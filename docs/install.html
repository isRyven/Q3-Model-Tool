	<TR class=BG0><TD>The tool is distributed as a zip-file. The zip-file contains the program-executable and a folder containing the images used as the initial skybox background.<BR>
	<BR>
	The installation of the tool is really quite simple: Just unpack the zip content into a folder of Your choice..</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Setting up the tool</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>Once the tool is unpacked, run the program.<BR>
	When You run it for the first time, You will get a dialog-window asking for the location of Your "Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory" folder.<BR>
	If You have this game installed, select the folder, and click the 'OK'-button.<BR>
	If You do not have Wolfenstein-ET installed, then simply ignore the dialog, and press the 'Cancel'-button.</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>The next image shows a computer where in fact multiple versions of Wolfenstein-ET are installed.<BR>
	I just select one of the folders, and click 'OK'.</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG0><TD>When You do not have Wolfenstein installed on Your computer, click 'Cancel' to continue.<BR></TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG0><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD class=TDnote>When providing the tool with the game-folder of Wolfenstein-ET, the actual needed PAK-file of that game is added to the list of used PAK-files.<BR>
	The tool searches through all these listed PAK-files when looking up textures/shaders/models.</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Adding game PAK-files</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>After acknowledging or canceling the first dialog, the program window will appear.<BR>
	When You provided a game-folder, there should be a PAK-file in the 'Game-PAKs'-list on the upper-right of the tool-window.<BR>
	If You did not provide an initial game-folder, the 'Game-PAKs'-list is still empty. In this case You should manually add any game-PAKs to the list.<BR>
	<BR>
	Click the 'Add PAK'-button to add a pak-file from Your own game.<BR>
	In Quake3 games, a pak file usually has the .pk3 extension, and its filename is something like pak0.pk3, pak1.pk3 or such alike..</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Selecting a game PAK-file</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>In this example, i selected a PAK-file of the NoQuarter MOD.<BR>
	Click the 'Open'-button when done selecting the PAK-file.</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG0><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
	
	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>A PAK-file has been added to the list</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>As You can see, the PAK-file has been added to the 'Game-PAKs'-list on the upper-right of the window.</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD><IMG src="img/Install_4.jpg"></TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Adding more PAK-files</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>You can add more PAK-files if You like. Just keep in mind that it will not make the tool faster, because it has to search all these files when looking for textures, shaders and/or models..<BR>
	Another point to be aware of, is that the files are searched from top-to-bottom as they appear in the list. So if, for example, the same shader should exist in more than one listed PAK-file, only the first found entry will be used while rendering/converting models.</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Ready for use</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>When You are done adding PAK-files, You can start using the tool.<BR>
	<BR>
	You can click the displayed, simple help (anywhere), to make it disappear, and to make the 'View'-Tab show up.<BR>
	<BR>
	Most important settings are saved on exit in an INI-file, including the PAKs-list.<BR>
	You only need to setup the tool once. At any time You can add (or remove) PAKs from the list.</TD></TR>
