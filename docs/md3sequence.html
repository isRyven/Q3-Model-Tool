	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Expand an MD3 with frames from a sequence of MD3-files</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>Suppose You want to create an animated MD3, but Your 3D-modeling software does not support the export of animated MD3-files, only exporting single-frame MD3-files is possible..<BR>
	This tool lets You combine a sequence of MD3-files into 1 animated MD3. A sequence of MD3-files needs to be using numbered filenames, like: file0.md3, file1.md3 ... file9.md3, file10.md3. Every one of these files must contain the model in a different pose, each file holds the next frame of an animation. All frames together form 1 complete animation.<BR>
	Maybe Your 3D-modeling software can save all the neccesary files automaticly. If not, You must save, and name the (numbered) files individually..<BR>
	<BR>
	Here is an example of a rotating MP40, combined from 35 frames (from 35 different MD3-files). In each frame the gun is rotated 10 degrees, so when the animation runs the gun spins from 0 to 350 degrees, and then starts at 0 degrees again, a complete 360..<BR>
	First things to do is load the first file manually. The first file contains the first frame of the animation.<BR>
	It doesn't matter how the first file is called, just load it.. ;-) In this demonstration the first file i need is called: mp40_fly_01.md3</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Select the option from the menu</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>Select the choice from the menu:<BR>
	"Add frames[0] from sequence..."</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG0><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
	
	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Select the rest of the sequence that must be added</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>The following dialog lets You choose all the needed files that complement the animation at once. To select multiple files: just select the first file like You normally do, then hold the SHIFT-key and select the last file from the sequence..<BR>
	The tool will load all the files, sort them on their sequencial filename-number, and add the first frame of every file to the MD3 You had already loaded.<BR>
	Note: Be sure NOT to select the first frame now, (file called mp40_fly_01.md3), because otherwise that frame will be doubled in the end-animation, and that is probably not what You want..</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Watch the animation</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>After the tool is finished loading all the files, and has combined all the files into 1 animated MD3, You immediately see the animation playing.<BR>
	Note that the Framenumber-sliders for 'Start Frame' & 'End Frame' on the bottom of the 'View'-Tab have also been set to the proper animation-length. The Start-Frame is set to 0 and the End-Frame is set to 34, that's 35 frames..</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Save the animated MD3</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>Now You only need to save the MD3. Select the "Save As..." option from the menu.<BR>
	The filetype of the file You can save is now automaticly set to MD3. You have nothing to do but to enter the name of Your new model-file.</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG0><TD>The name i have chosen is: mp40_fly_anim.md3</TD></TR>

	<TR class=BG1T><TD class=BG1T colspan=2>Restrictions</TD></TR>
	<TR class=BG0><TD>All files that are used to combine the final MD3 must contain the same model. That is, the files must have:<BR>
	<LI type=square>the same number of surfaces,</LI><BR>
	<LI type=square>the same shaders,</LI><BR>
	<LI type=square>the same number of vertices per surface,</LI><BR>
	<LI type=square>the same number of tags.</LI><BR>
	You will get an error-message if one of those criteria is not met, and no frame will be added.</TD></TR>
